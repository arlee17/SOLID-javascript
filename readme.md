# SOLID in Javascript

### These are five important principles in object-oriented programming (OOP) known as SOLID principles

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
This principle states that a class should have only one responsibility or reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one job, and if it needs to change, it should be for one and only one reason. This principle helps to make classes more maintainable and easier to understand, as each class has a clear purpose and functionality.

- Open-Closed Principle (OCP): 
This principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality to a system without changing existing code. This principle helps to maintain the existing codebase while allowing it to be easily extended.

- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): 
This principle states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be able to be used wherever its superclass is used, without causing unexpected behavior. This principle helps to ensure that inheritance is used correctly and that subclasses do not break the functionality of their superclass.

- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 
This principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, a class should not have to implement methods it does not need. This principle helps to ensure that classes are not bloated with unnecessary functionality and that interfaces are designed with a specific purpose.

- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 
This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. In other words, classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes, rather than concrete implementations. This principle helps to make code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.

These five principles together form the SOLID acronym, and they provide guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code in OOP.
